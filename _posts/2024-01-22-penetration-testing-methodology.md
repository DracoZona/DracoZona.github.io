# Penetration Testing Methodology with Visual Guide

Penetration testing follows a structured methodology to ensure comprehensive security assessment. This guide provides a visual walkthrough of the entire process.

## Penetration Testing Phases

The standard penetration testing methodology consists of five main phases:

![Penetration Testing Phases](pentest-phases.png)

### 1. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)

The first phase involves gathering as much information as possible about the target:

#### Passive Reconnaissance
- **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)**
- Social media profiling
- DNS enumeration
- Whois lookups
- Google dorking

```bash
# DNS enumeration
dig target.com ANY
nslookup target.com

# Subdomain discovery
subfinder -d target.com
amass enum -d target.com
```

#### Active Reconnaissance
- Port scanning
- Service enumeration
- Banner grabbing
- Network mapping

### 2. Scanning and Enumeration

This phase involves active probing of the target systems:

#### Network Scanning
```bash
# Nmap comprehensive scan
nmap -sS -sV -sC -O -A target.com

# UDP scan
nmap -sU --top-ports 1000 target.com

# Vulnerability scanning
nmap --script vuln target.com
```

#### Service Enumeration
- HTTP/HTTPS services
- SMB shares
- FTP services
- SSH services
- Database services

### 3. Vulnerability Assessment

Identify potential security weaknesses:

#### Automated Scanning
```bash
# Web application scanning
nikto -h https://target.com
dirb https://target.com

# Network vulnerability scanning
nessus_scan target.com
openvas_scan target.com
```

#### Manual Testing
- Code review
- Configuration analysis
- Business logic flaws
- Authentication mechanisms

### 4. Exploitation

Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities:

#### Web Application Exploitation
```bash
# SQL injection testing
sqlmap -u "https://target.com/page?id=1" --dbs

# XSS testing
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
```

#### Network Exploitation
```bash
# Metasploit framework
msfconsole
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
set RHOSTS target_ip
exploit
```

#### Post-Exploitation
- Privilege escalation
- Lateral movement
- Data exfiltration
- Persistence mechanisms

### 5. Reporting

Document findings and provide remediation guidance:

#### Report Structure
1. **Executive Summary**
2. **Technical Findings**
3. **Risk Assessment**
4. **Remediation Recommendations**
5. **Appendices**

## Methodology Frameworks

### OWASP Testing Guide
The OWASP Web Security Testing Guide provides comprehensive methodology for web application security testing.

### NIST SP 800-115
Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment provides federal guidelines for security testing.

### PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)
Comprehensive standard covering all phases of penetration testing.

### OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)
Scientific methodology for security testing and analysis.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Authorization Requirements
- **Written permission** from system owners
- **Scope definition** and boundaries
- **Rules of engagement** documentation
- **Emergency contacts** and procedures

### Ethical Guidelines
- Minimize system disruption
- Protect confidential information
- Report vulnerabilities responsibly
- Follow professional standards

![Legal Framework](legal-framework.png)

## Best Practices

### Documentation
- Maintain detailed logs
- Screenshot evidence
- Command history
- Vulnerability details

### Communication
- Regular status updates
- Immediate critical findings
- Clear technical explanations
- Executive summaries

### Quality Assurance
- Peer review findings
- Validate exploits
- Verify remediation
- Follow-up testing

## Advanced Techniques

### Red Team Operations
- Social engineering
- Physical security testing
- Assumed breach scenarios
- Advanced persistent threats (APT) simulation

### Purple Team Exercises
- Collaborative testing
- Real-time feedback
- Detection improvement
- Response validation

## Conclusion

Effective penetration testing requires a structured methodology, proper tools, and ethical conduct. The visual guides in this post help illustrate the complex processes involved in comprehensive security assessment.

Remember: Always obtain proper authorization before conducting any penetration testing activities.

## Image Usage

To include images in your blog posts, simply:

1. Place image files in the `images/` folder
2. Reference them in markdown: `![Alt text](filename.png)`
3. The build system automatically converts them to proper HTML

*Stay ethical, stay methodical, and keep testing!*
