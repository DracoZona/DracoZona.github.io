# Advanced Buffer Overflow Exploitation

Buffer overflows remain one of the most critical vulnerabilities in software security. While basic stack overflows are well-understood, modern exploitation requires sophisticated techniques to bypass current protection mechanisms.

## Understanding Modern Protections

Today's systems implement multiple layers of protection:

### Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
ASLR randomizes memory layout, making it difficult to predict addresses. However, information leaks can defeat this protection.

### Data Execution Prevention (DEP/NX)
DEP prevents code execution in data segments, forcing attackers to use Return-Oriented Programming (ROP).

## Advanced Exploitation Techniques

### Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)

ROP chains allow code execution without injecting shellcode:

```assembly
; Example ROP gadget
pop rdi
ret
```

### Practical Example

Here's a vulnerable C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void vulnerable_function(char *input) {
    char buffer[64];
    strcpy(buffer, input);  // Vulnerable!
}
```

## Conclusion

Buffer overflow exploitation continues to evolve alongside defensive measures. Understanding these techniques is crucial for both offensive security professionals and developers building secure applications.
